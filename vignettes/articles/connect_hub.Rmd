An important function of `hubData` is allowing for the connection to data in the `model-output` directory to facilitate extraction, filtering, querying, exploring, and analyzing of Hub data.

# Structure of hubverse datasets

All data returned from connecting to and querying hubs can be read or validated as a `model_out_tbl` which is a foundational S3 class in the hubverse ecosystem. A `model_out_tbl` is a long-form [`tibble`](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) designed to conform to the [hubverse data specifications for model output data](https://hubverse.io/en/latest/user-guide/model-output.html). In short, the columns of a valid `model_out_tbl` containing model output data from a hub are:

 - `model_id`: this is the unique character identifier of a model.
 - `output_type`: a character variable that defines the type of representation of model output that is in a given row.
 - `output_type_id`: a variable that specifies some additional identifying information specific to the output type in a given row, e.g., a numeric quantile level, a string giving the name of a possible category for a discrete outcome, or an index of a sample.
 - `value`: a numeric variable that provides the information about the model's prediction.
 - `...` : other columns will be present depending on modeling tasks defined by the individual modeling hub. These columns are referred to in hubverse terminology as the `task-ID` variables.

Other hubverse tools, designed for data validation, [ensemble building](https://hubverse-org.github.io/hubEnsembles/), [visualization](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubVis), etc..., all are designed with the "promises" implicit in the data format specified by `model_out_tbl`. For example, [the `hubEnsembles::linear_pool()` function ](https://hubverse-org.github.io/hubEnsembles/reference/linear_pool.html) both accepts as input and returns as output `model_out_tbl` objects.

# Hub connections

There are two functions for connecting to `model-output` data:

- `connect_hub()` is used for connecting to fully configured hubs (i.e. which contain valid `admin.json` and `tasks.json` in a `hub-config` directory). This function uses configurations defined in config files in the `hub-config/` directory and allows for connecting to hubs with files in multiple file formats (allowable formats specified by the `file_format` property of `admin.json`).
- `connect_model_output()` allows for connecting directly to the contents of a `model-output` directory and is useful for connecting to appropriately organised files in an informal hub (i.e. which has not been fully configured with appropriate `hub-config/` files.)

Both functions establish connections through the [`arrow`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/) package, specifically by opening datasets as [`FileSystemDataset`s](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/Dataset.html), one for each file format. 
Both functions are also able to connect to files that are stored locally or in the cloud (e.g. in AWS S3 buckets).

Where multiple file formats are accepted in a single Hub, file format specific `FileSystemDataset`s are combined into a single `UnionDataset` for single point access to the entire Hub `model-output` dataset. 
This only applies to `connect_hub()` in fully configured Hubs, where config files can be used to determine a unifying schema across all file formats. 

In contract, `connect_model_output()` can only be used to open single file format datasets of the format defined explicitly through the `file_format` argument.


```{r setup}
library(hubData)
library(dplyr)
```

# Connecting to a configured hub

## Connecting to a local hub

To connect to a local hub, supply the path to the hub to `connect_hub()`

```{r}
hub_path <- system.file("testhubs/flusight", package = "hubUtils")
hub_con <- connect_hub(hub_path)
hub_con
```

## Connecting to a hub in the cloud

To connect to a hub in the cloud, first use one of the re-exported `arrow` helpers `s3_bucket()` or `gs_bucket()` depending on the cloud storage provider, and a string of the bucket name/path to create the appropriate cloud `*FileSystem` object (For more details consult the `arrow` article on [Using cloud storage (S3, GCS)](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/fs.html)).

Then supply the resulting `*FileSystem` object to `connect_hub()`.

```{r}
hub_path_cloud <- s3_bucket("hubverse/hubutils/testhubs/simple/")
hub_con_cloud <- connect_hub(hub_path_cloud)
hub_con_cloud
```

### Performance considerations

By default, `connect_hub` will ignore invalid files in the hub's model output directory when it creates a connection. This check prevents errors when working with the data, but it negatively impacts performance.

If the cloud-based hub uses a single file type for model output data, you can improve performance by using the `skip_checks` argument. This argument will bypass the default behavior of scanning the hub's model output directory for invalid files before connecting.

Using this argument will fail unless the hub meets the following criteria:

- the model output directory contains only model output data (no `README.md`, for example)
- the model output files use a single file format.

```{r}
hub_path_cloud <- s3_bucket("hubverse/hubutils/testhubs/parquet/")
hub_con_cloud <- connect_hub(hub_path_cloud, file_format = "parquet", skip_checks = TRUE)
hub_con_cloud
```

# Accessing data

To access data from a hub connection you can use dplyr verbs and construct querying pipelines.

To perform the queries, you can use `dplyr`'s `collect()` function:
```{r}
hub_con %>%
  filter(output_type == "quantile", location == "US") %>%
  collect()
```

Note however that in the above example, while the output contains the required `model_id`, `output_type`, `output_type_id` and `value` columns for a `model_out_tbl` object, it is returned as a `tbl_df` or `tibble` object and the order of the columns is not standardised.

## Use `collect_hub()` to return `model_out_tbl`s

Conveniently, you can use the `hubData` wrapper `collect_hub()` which converts the output of `dplyr::collect()` to a `model_out_tbl` class object where possible:

```{r}
tbl <- hub_con %>%
  filter(output_type == "quantile", location == "US") %>%
  collect_hub()

tbl

class(tbl)
```

## Accessing data from cloud hubs

Accessing data from hubs in the cloud is exactly the same:

```{r}
hub_con_cloud %>%
  filter(output_type == "quantile", location == "US") %>%
  collect_hub()
```

## Limitations of `dplyr` queries on `arrow` datasets

Note that [not all `dplyr` filtering options are available](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/r/reference/acero.html) on arrow datasets.

For example, if you wanted to get all quantile predictions for the last forecast date in the hub, you might try:

```{r, error=TRUE}
hub_con %>%
  filter(
    output_type == "quantile", location == "US",
    forecast_date == max(forecast_date, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  collect_hub()
```

This doesn't work however as `arrow` does not have an equivalent `max` method for `Date[32]` data types.

In such a situation, you could collect after applying the first filtering level which does work for arrow and then finish the filtering on the in-memory data returned by collect.

```{r}
hub_con %>%
  filter(output_type == "quantile", location == "US") %>%
  collect_hub() %>%
  filter(forecast_date == max(forecast_date))
```

Alternatively, depending on the size of the data, in might be quicker to filter the data in two steps:

1. get the last forecast date available for the filtered subset.
2. use the last forecast date in the filtering query.

```{r}
last_forecast <- hub_con %>%
  filter(output_type == "quantile", location == "US") %>%
  pull(forecast_date, as_vector = TRUE) %>%
  max(na.rm = TRUE)


hub_con %>%
  filter(
    output_type == "quantile", location == "US",
    forecast_date == last_forecast
  ) %>%
  collect_hub()
```

### Use `arrow::to_duckdb()` to extend available queries 

You could alternatively use `arrow::to_duckdb()` to first convert the dataset connection to an in memory virtual DuckDB table. This will allows you to run queries that are supported by DuckDB but not by arrow, extending the potential queries that can be run against hub data before collecting.

_For more details see [DuckDB quacks Arrow: A zero-copy data integration between Apache Arrow and DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/2021/12/03/duck-arrow.html)._

```{r}
hub_con %>%
  arrow::to_duckdb() %>%
  filter(
    output_type == "quantile", location == "US",
    forecast_date == max(forecast_date, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  collect_hub()
```


# Connecting to a model output directory

There is also an option to connect directly to a model output directory without using any metadata in a hub config file. This can be useful when a hub has not been fully configured yet. 

The approach does have certain limitations though. For example, an overall unifying schema cannot be determined from the config files so the ability of `open_dataset()` to connect and parse data correctly cannot be guaranteed across files.

In addition, only a single file_format dataset can be opened.

```{r}
model_output_dir <- system.file("testhubs/simple/model-output", package = "hubUtils")
mod_out_con <- connect_model_output(model_output_dir, file_format = "csv")
mod_out_con
```

Accessing data follows the same procedure described for fully configured hubs:

```{r}
mod_out_con %>%
  filter(output_type == "quantile", location == "US") %>%
  collect_hub()
```

And connecting to cloud model output data follows the same procedure described for fully configured cloud hubs:

```{r}
mod_out_dir_cloud <- s3_bucket(
  "hubverse/hubutils/testhubs/simple/model-output/"
)
mod_out_con_cloud <- connect_model_output(
  mod_out_dir_cloud,
  file_format = "csv"
)
mod_out_con_cloud
```

Like `connect_hub`, `connect_model_output` has an optional `skip_checks` argument that improves performance:

```{r}
mod_out_dir_cloud <- s3_bucket("hubverse/hubutils/testhubs/parquet/model-output/")
mod_out_con_cloud <- connect_hub(mod_out_dir_cloud, file_format = "parquet", skip_checks = TRUE)
mod_out_con_cloud
```

## Providing a custom schema 

When connecting to a model output directly, you can also specify a schema to override the default arrow schema auto-detection. This can help at times to resolve conflicts in data types across different dataset files.

```{r}
library(arrow)

model_output_schema <- schema(
  origin_date = date32(),
  target = string(),
  horizon = int32(),
  location = string(),
  output_type = string(),
  output_type_id = string(),
  value = int32(),
  model_id = string()
)

mod_out_con <- connect_model_output(model_output_dir,
  file_format = "csv",
  schema = model_output_schema
)
mod_out_con
```

Using a schema can however also produce new errors which can sometimes be hard to debug. For example, here we are defining a schema with field `output_type` cast as `int32` data type. As column `output_type` actually contain character type data which cannot be coerced to integer, connecting to the model output directory produces an `arrow` error. 


```{r, error=TRUE}
model_output_schema <- schema(
  origin_date = date32(),
  target = string(),
  horizon = int32(),
  location = string(),
  output_type = int32(),
  output_type_id = string(),
  value = int32(),
  model_id = string()
)

mod_out_con <- connect_model_output(model_output_dir,
  file_format = "csv",
  schema = model_output_schema
)
```

Beware that `arrow` errors can be somewhat misleading at times so if you do get such a non-informative error, a good place to start would be to check your schema matches the columns and your data can be coerced to the data types specified in the schema.
